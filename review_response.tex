\begin{revcomment}
	Your work is really good. However, you should change the title.
\end{revcomment}

\end{generalcomment}
\begin{revresponse}[Thank you for your feedback.]
	We have carefully addressed all the issues item by item as follows.

\begin{revcomment}\label{comment:work-not-good}
	The work is not really good.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	:(
\end{revresponse}

\begin{revcomment}
	You forgot to cite a very important reference (where I am an author)!
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We are aware that citations on Google Scholar are very important to you.
	Therefore, we added reference \cite{ReviewerReference}.

	Also check out our article \cite{Besser2020}.
	
	And btw, your \autoref{comment:work-not-good} was mean! (We can use the \verb|\autoref| command.)

\begin{revcomment}
	Did you know, that the references can be separated for the individual reviewers?
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	Yes. When using \href{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex}{biblatex}, you can use the \texttt{refsection=section} option to achieve that.
	If we cite a new reference like \cite{Besser2021} here, it will again be number [1].

	Note that you might have to run \texttt{pdflatex} and \texttt{biber} multiple times.

	And reference [1] for \autoref{rev:2}~\cite{ReviewerReference} is now number [2].
